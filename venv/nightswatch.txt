Night gathers
and now my watch begins.
It shall not end until my death.
I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children.
I shall wear no crowns and win no glory.
I shall live and die at my post.
I am the sword in the darkness.
I am the watcher on the walls.
I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men.
I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night, and all the nights to come.
